Transferring from Vanderbilt to brown	30	ke6769	https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/ke6769/transferring_from_vanderbilt_to_brown/	11	1608140101.0	"Hi friends,
I’m currently a freshman at Vanderbilt and Brown has been my dream dream dream school ever since middle school. I ED brown and got rejected so I was sad and ED2 Vanderbilt. 

Honestly, my first semester at Vanderbilt was great: my gpa was 4, I met new friends even under COVID and the professors were fascinating. 

But I still feel sad whenever I think about Brown. Emotionally I see brown as a better fit for me even though I strive at Vanderbilt. Should I transfer? What would be my narrative if I transfer? (I was literally crying when I’m writing these sentences lol)

Any advice would be extremely helpful! Thank you so much!!

EDIT: My possible direction could be art/ art history + chemistry/ cs

I'm a very interdisciplinary person so I'm currently undecided lol. Overall, I like the combination of art and stem. Starting from my high school I'm thinking to be a art conservator in the future which requires visual art knowledge and chemistry skills. But this year due to COVID, I have no access to lab and studio, so I didn't take chemistry and visual art courses. Instead, I took an introductory cs course and several art history courses. I think I enjoy them and start thinking about taking cs+hart as another possible direction. 

So overall my possible majors could be a combination of art+ chemistry or art history+ cs or something similar lol"	depression	BrownU

i wanted to know if anyone can give me advice for the program/applying to it. im superr interested. 


soo 
i love art and spend some time in it, but i've always put more focus in academics and extracurriculars cuz i felt like that was the place to develop myself in to get scholarship to study abroad. (im from a third world country)

i never though studying art would be an option because 1) ""you can't live off art"" and 2) i really like science and sports stuff so i could live without actually studying it (i think i'd go for studio art) 

a couple of months back i found the dual degree program and fell in love. i felt like i found my ""place"". when i told my mom that was my dream school/program, i was literally crying tears of happiness because i finally felt i fitted in with my 2 passions. 

i'll be applying this fall as i graduate in 2021. 
if anyone can give me advice of how this program works when you are actually studying there / any tips for application i would appreciate it so MUCHH"	depression	BrownU
How do I appeal to Brown Financial Aid? Just received a really disappointing package :/	21	fuucjo	https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fuucjo/how_do_i_appeal_to_brown_financial_aid_just/	5	1586038337.0	"Hey guys!

Just got accepted to Brown RD and I was so excited to commit until I got my financial aid package this morning. 

For some context, I’m an international student living in Manila, but I am an American citizen and I qualify for FAFSA. My family makes less that $100k/year and although we do have some assets, my impression based on research and past experiences of other lower income Brown admits is that my family would have received substantial financial aid.

We only received $12k/year making our total estimated cost over $70k/year. I almost cried when I saw this because I was so disheartened. I’m not sure if I can even afford to go to this school anymore. :(

Additional info: I filed my FAFSA late due to logistical errors with mailing parent signatures that were entirely out of my control due to the delays caused by COVID. Would this have affected why my award is so low?

Does anyone have any advice on how to appeal for more? My tuition at Brown would practically be the same amount as my family’s income in a year. 

Any advice or past experiences would really help! Please help a hopeful Brown student afford college!"	depression	BrownU

I'd love to go to Brown and it seems like the perfect school for me; I've already asked people why they chose to go there, what they love, etc. But what are the ""downsides"" that you've experienced, and do you have any advice regarding them?

Transferring from Vanderbilt to brown	30	ke6769	https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/ke6769/transferring_from_vanderbilt_to_brown/	11	1608140101.0	"Hi friends,
I’m currently a freshman at Vanderbilt and Brown has been my dream dream dream school ever since middle school. I ED brown and got rejected so I was sad and ED2 Vanderbilt. 

Honestly, my first semester at Vanderbilt was great: my gpa was 4, I met new friends even under COVID and the professors were fascinating. 

But I still feel sad whenever I think about Brown. Emotionally I see brown as a better fit for me even though I strive at Vanderbilt. Should I transfer? What would be my narrative if I transfer? (I was literally crying when I’m writing these sentences lol)

Any advice would be extremely helpful! Thank you so much!!

EDIT: My possible direction could be art/ art history + chemistry/ cs

I'm a very interdisciplinary person so I'm currently undecided lol. Overall, I like the combination of art and stem. Starting from my high school I'm thinking to be a art conservator in the future which requires visual art knowledge and chemistry skills. But this year due to COVID, I have no access to lab and studio, so I didn't take chemistry and visual art courses. Instead, I took an introductory cs course and several art history courses. I think I enjoy them and start thinking about taking cs+hart as another possible direction. 

So overall my possible majors could be a combination of art+ chemistry or art history+ cs or something similar lol"	crying	BrownU
Interested in the Brown|Risd dual degree program	23	gk4fwj	https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/gk4fwj/interested_in_the_brownrisd_dual_degree_program/	13	1589555735.0	"prospectice student here!!

i wanted to know if anyone can give me advice for the program/applying to it. im superr interested. 


soo 
i love art and spend some time in it, but i've always put more focus in academics and extracurriculars cuz i felt like that was the place to develop myself in to get scholarship to study abroad. (im from a third world country)

i never though studying art would be an option because 1) ""you can't live off art"" and 2) i really like science and sports stuff so i could live without actually studying it (i think i'd go for studio art) 

a couple of months back i found the dual degree program and fell in love. i felt like i found my ""place"". when i told my mom that was my dream school/program, i was literally crying tears of happiness because i finally felt i fitted in with my 2 passions. 

i'll be applying this fall as i graduate in 2021. 
if anyone can give me advice of how this program works when you are actually studying there / any tips for application i would appreciate it so MUCHH"	crying	BrownU
How do I appeal to Brown Financial Aid? Just received a really disappointing package :/	21	fuucjo	https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fuucjo/how_do_i_appeal_to_brown_financial_aid_just/	5	1586038337.0	"Hey guys!

Just got accepted to Brown RD and I was so excited to commit until I got my financial aid package this morning. 

For some context, I’m an international student living in Manila, but I am an American citizen and I qualify for FAFSA. My family makes less that $100k/year and although we do have some assets, my impression based on research and past experiences of other lower income Brown admits is that my family would have received substantial financial aid.

We only received $12k/year making our total estimated cost over $70k/year. I almost cried when I saw this because I was so disheartened. I’m not sure if I can even afford to go to this school anymore. :(

Additional info: I filed my FAFSA late due to logistical errors with mailing parent signatures that were entirely out of my control due to the delays caused by COVID. Would this have affected why my award is so low?

Does anyone have any advice on how to appeal for more? My tuition at Brown would practically be the same amount as my family’s income in a year. 

Any advice or past experiences would really help! Please help a hopeful Brown student afford college!"	crying	BrownU
